        <h2>      A Brief History of Bitcoin:</h2>

        <br>
        <p class="w3-medium">

            The intent of this dashboard is to provide a brief synopsis of some of the major Bitcoin historical events while simultaneously showing the price of Bitcoin at that period.

            </br></br>
            The first scene will contain the overall price graph alongside 11 annotations/steps. The order of the steps are from left to right in historical order.
            The user can click on any of them, but the intent is to begin with the first one and move down the order. As the user clicks on each step, the graph will update
            for some of the steps based on the relative time, and the appropriate annotation will be displayed in the updated chart.

            </br></br>
            The visualization uses a set range dates which filters the data and re-renders the graph when clicking on a step. I did this to attempt to look at the price of Bitcoin as
            some historical events occurred. At the end you can see the overall price graph and see if you can remember where those events happened.

            </br></br>
            The scenes will end 20 seconds after hitting the final step ETF. This will transition back to the original overall graph with no annotations.

            </br></br>
